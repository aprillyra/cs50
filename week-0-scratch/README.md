# A Dog's Dream

A Scratch game I created based on my dog's love of food and hatred for rain.

To play, visit [A Dog's Dream](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/949208596) on Scratch.

To read about my process in creating this game, visit my blog post: [starting from scratch](https://april.bearblog.dev/starting-from-scratch/)

This is my solution to the [Scratch](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/0/scratch/) problem for Harvard CS50's Problem Set 0.
