# filter

This is my solution to [Filter](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/4/filter/less/) for Harvard CS50's Problem Set 4.

This program allows a user to apply grayscale, sepia, reflection, or blur filters to their images.

For this problem, CS50's staff provided the code for _bmp.h_, _filters.c_, and _helpers.h_.

I implemented the functions in _helpers.c_.
